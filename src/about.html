          <h2 class="title-2">Our story</h2>
          <p> <strong>We started SOFY as a testing platform with the goal of fully automating UI and functional testing
              of mobile apps. We infused the platform with lots of ML to add intelligence to our testing, so it does not
              have challenges of brute force automation techniques.  </strong></p>
          <p>We certainly believe the best way to judge the quality of an application is how it is used by customers.
            Working closely with customers, we realized that our customers needed a mix of manual and automated testing
            and a way to seamlessly move between the two without having to retrain their development teams. </p>
          <p>As a result, we designed and recently launched SOFY Live and SOFY Automate to alleviate these customer pain
            points. </p>

              <p>My Story: <span class="green">Syed Hamid,</span> Founder & CEO</p>
            </div>
            <p> <strong>Prior to founding SOFY, I worked for 18 years at Microsoft, starting as a developer, then a Dev
                Manager, and eventually an Engineering leader in the company. We tried to automate as many of the
                repetitive tasks to avoid human error and increase developer productivity and focus our engineers on
                delivering value to the business which is to build functionality and capabilities within the product.  
              </strong></p>
            <p>One area that persistently frustrated me was the inability to automate UI and functional testing. I
              managed
              a large development budget and witnessed an increasing portion of my budget went to QA testing as well as
              hiring a large number of tester engineers. </p>
            <p>The more I looked into solving this problem and talked with fellow engineering leaders in my professional
              network, it was clear that the industry was in desperate need of innovation in this area of UI and
              functional testing as the testing paradigm in this area had not changed for over 25 years. Coincidentally,
              the proliferation of AI made the technologies needed to solve this problem more accessible. This
              eventually
              led me to leave my current job and start SOFY. </p>
            <p>I hope you will give us a try, provide your feedback so that we can continue to evolve SOFY and meet your
              needs into the future. </p>
